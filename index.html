			<h2>Spaghetti Carbonara</h2>
			<div id="intro">
				<p>This easy pasta sauce will cook in about the same time it takes to cook some dried pasta in boiling salted water – we’re talking about quick and easy options here. These amounts serve 2 but are easy to scale up or down. Remember you want about 75g of dried pasta per person – use whatever shape you’ve got. Or, check out my super-simple method for fresh pasta, using just flour and water.</p>

		<div id="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ui>
			<li>150g dried spaghetti</li>
			<li class="meat">2 rashers of higher-welfare smoked streaky bacon</li>
			<li>1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
			<li>2 free-range eggs</li>
			<li>30g Parmesan cheese, plus extra for grating</li>
		</ul></div>

		<div id="steps"><h3>Steps</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions.</li>
				<li class="meat">Slice the bacon and place in a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with half a tablespoon of olive oil and a really good pinch of black pepper. Leave it to get super-golden and crispy, tossing occasionally, then turn off the heat.</li>	
				<li>Meanwhile, beat the eggs in a bowl, then finely grate in the Parmesan and mix well.</li>
				<il>Use tongs to transfer your pasta straight into the pan and toss.</li>
				<il>Pour the Parmesan eggs into the pan, and keep everything moving, loosening with splashes of the pasta cooking water until you have a silky sauce. Make sure the pan is not too hot otherwise the eggs will scramble.</i>
				<li>Plate up the pasta, and finish with an extra grating of Parmesan.</li></main>
