When I first started working on the <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/web-design" target="_blank">Team Treehouse How to Build a Website Course</a>, I didn't have the right computer for web design or programming of any kind.  I had an HP netbook with the resultant tiny memory.  It was the only computer I had, however, and I bricked it working the course over the internet.  

What I learned: no matter how much you delete of various superfluous files and such, a netbook <i>cannot</i> support the memory needed to work on various stages of web design, much less the huge amout of staging that goes into learning programming, itself.  Git is a Version Control System and while learning it -- just a VCS, mind you, not Ruby or Java or anything else I'm working on now...as my mother said, "This thing is toast."

Pixelapse didn't exist when I started learning Adobe Photoshop in high school.  I'm absolutely certain that if it had, my Visual Imaging course would have made learning how to navigate it mandatory for the course.  That and <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/wireframes/top-wireframing-tools-11121302" target="_blank">pretty much any wireframing tool on this very comprehensive list from Creative Bloq</a>.

As it is, I'm restarting the project from scratch and posting the results both here and on my <a href="https://github.com/Angelfirenze01" target="_blank">Github account</a>.

I hope you'll enjoy it, too.
