I rewrote the entire Team Treehouse's How To Make A Website course after reviewing the first parts and realizing I don't like my original attempt, which was written with the boilerplate design specs.

I realized it was a lot more interesting, not to mention fun, if I used my own photographs saved in my Instagram account, and my Photobucket.

I found out over time that I've enjoyed the course a lot more while thinking up my own styles to impart upon the original stylesheet.  This time I'm creating the newer boilerplate to learn the enhancements and breakthroughs in HTML5/CSS3 since I last attempted the entire HTML/CSS course, itself.  I hope to get back to the HTML-Forms section of the Tracksooner rather than later.
