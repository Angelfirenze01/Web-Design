				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>I'm an aspiring full-stack developer, incidental hacker, aspiring vegan, and student of a lot of different things, especially web programming and cooking.  My favorite shows are Adventure Time, DaVinci's Demons, Mr. Robot, and Shameless - US, as well as Doctor Who.</p>

				<p>I'm also a life-long nerd who loves The Big Bang Theory and the expanded Joss Whedon universe, which - for me - includes not only the shows (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, ANGEL, and Firefly/<i>Serenity</i>, but the books written by Christopher Golden, Nancy Holder, and others.</p> 

				<p>Other 'fandoms' I enjoy include <u>Harry Potter</u>, <u>The Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini</u>, <u>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</u> series by Douglas Adams, and Jasper Fforde's Nursery Crimes series, as well as his <u>Thursday Next</u> series.</p>

				<p>I have been learning programming since 2004 and have become proficient in Git while testing as proficient in Adobe Photoshop, as well as Git and HTML/CSS.  I hope to become proficient in Ruby, Java, PHP, and other back-end languages, as well as full-stack (and possible MEAN) Javascript.  Even more than that, I've been studying online security both on Team Treehouse and from books like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Privacy-Security-Desk-Reference/dp/152277890X?sa-no-redirect=1">The Complete Security Desk Reference</a> by Justin Carroll and Michael Bazzell and am always interested in ways to make my life as impervious to Black Hat hackers as I can.</p>

				<b>My ultimate goal is a job in programming and to use the <a href="http://www.greengaragedetroit.com/site/" target="_blank">Green Garage coworking space here in Detroit, then a medical degree in Forensic Pathology.</b>
